	      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here we summarize the composition of the listening section of the CBT TOEFL test as likely encountered today. This is the section that has changed most significantly in recent years and may change more drastically in coming years because of the development of computer technology. There are two parts within the listening section.</font></p>
		   <ul>
			<li><p><b>Listening Part A: short conversations</b></p>
			
				<p>There are either 11 or 17 short conversations, of which mostly have a man and a woman speaking. In this part, the picture you see provides no useful information, serving only as a distracter; Therefore, avoid concentrating on this image.</p>
			<li><p><b>Listening Part B: longer conversations, discussions, and lectures</b></p>
				<p>You are given either 20 or 33 questions, meaning about 5 to 7 conversations, discussions and lectures: The speakers talk at natural speed, and the average length of each piece is 2 minutes. 
				<p>Please note that, unlike with the short conversations, the pictures in Part B are of importance in understanding and answering questions about the lecture. 
				<p>ETS is making only rare use of its complicated non-multiple choice questions, but there may be some use of Matching/Ordering and Click on Diagram questions.</p>
		  </ul>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>


              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="2"><table bgColor="#C6E2FF"><tr><td><b>Listening Section Type Insights</b></td></tr></table></a></font></p>
	      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most items in Part A make use of indirect answers, false questions, voice inflection, sound alike traps and phrasal verb expressions. They test your ability to understand and find out hidden meaning or implication.</font></p>
	      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, most questions and answers in Part B are directly based on listening content. They test your ability to catch the main ideas as well as remember details after hearing a longer talk.</font></p>
	      <ol>
		<li>What the first person says usually does not contain the answer to the question, but what the second person says is the real key to the answer. Thus, pay more attention to the second person. For example,<br><br>
		<ul>
		<b>Female:</b> Why are you leaving so early?  The movie doesnt start till seven.<br>
		<b>Male:</b> I dont want to be at the traffic there.  Its a nightmare on the expressway during rush hour.<br>
		<b>Question:</b> What does the man mean?<br><br>

		&#9830 He wants to go early to avoid a traffic jam.<br>
    		&#959 He wants to leave the theater before the movie is over.<br>
		&#959 He doesn't know the way to the theater.<br>
    		&#959 He doesn't usually get up at 7:00.<br><br>
		</ul>

		<li>Listening for intonation is very important. A rising tone often indicates a question or disagreement, and a falling tone often indicated agreement. For example,<br><br>
		<ul>
		<b>Female:</b> Isnt it great about Ruths community service award?<br>
		<b>Male:</b> She deserved it.<br>
		<b>Question:</b>What does the man mean?<br><br>
		&#9830 Ruth earned the award.<br>
		&#959 Ruth helped plan the award ceremony.<br>
		&#959 Ruth should work more for the community.<br>
		&#959 Ruth served as chairperson of the committee.<br><br><br>

		<b>Female:</b> Its a tradition.  Every New Years Day my sister and I go skating on the lake.<br>
		<b>Male:</b> Has it been cold enough this winter?  Or will you go indoors?<br>
		<b>Question:</b>What does the man imply?<br><br>
		&#959 It's been too cold to go skating this winter.<br>
   		&#959 The woman can go indoors if she gets cold.<br>
   		&#9830 The lake may not have frozen.<br>
		&#959 He also likes to skate in the winter.<br><br>
		</ul>

		<li>Pay attention to contrary conjunctions, like, but, however, etc. The content after 'but' is usually to suggest a contrary or negative way in light of the first clause, which is the vital part of the talk. For example,<br><br>
		<ul>
		<b>Female:</b> Gee, Tom, I hear that you are working as a house painter this summer. It's got to be awfully hot working up there on a ladder in the blazing sun all day.<br>
		<b>Male:</b> Well it's hard work, but I get to be outdoors and the pay is decent.<br>
		<b>Question:</b>What does the man imply? <br><br>

		&#959 He makes more money than the woman.<br>
		&#9830 He's satisfied with his job.<br>
		&#959 He had trouble finding a job.<br>
		&#959 He doesn't like working outdoors.<br><br>
		</ul>
		
		<li>The first person uses one kind of interrogative sentences (yes-no questions). The answer of the second person is either yes or no. We review lots of the real test items and find out that more than 90% cases are with no-answer. Thus, if you totally have no idea about what the second person says, the good guess is to choose an answer that is opposed to the first person's opinion. For example,<br><br>

		<ul>
		<b>Female</b> Professor, have you graded my term paper yet?<br>
		<b>Male</b> To tell you the truth, Ive been tied up in committee meetings all week.<br>
		<b>Question:</b> What can be inferred about the paper?<br><br>

		&#959 The committee is discussing it.<br>
		&#959 It received a low grade.<br>
		&#9830 It hasn't been graded.<br>
		&#959 The woman hasn't submitted it.<br><br>
		</ul>

		<li>Understand subjunctive mood. The subjunctive mood is quite simply a form of the verb when a person stops dealing with real things about which we can argue and starts dealing with uncertainties such as wishes, commands and unreal circumstances. The central point is unreal. For example,<br><br>
		<ul>
		<b>Male:</b> I really enjoyed that TV special about whales last night.  Did you get home in time to see it?<br>
		<b>Female:</b> Well, yes.  But I wish I couldve stayed awake long enough to see the whole thing.<br>
		<b>Questions:</b> What does the woman mean?<br><br>

		&#9830 She fell asleep before the program ended.<br>
		&#959 She especially enjoyed the end of the program.<br>
		&#959 She missed the beginning of the program.<br>
		&#959 She wishes she had gone to sleep earlier.<br><br>
		</ul>

		<li>Handle implication and inference. If the question is "What does the man/woman imply?" or "What can be inferred from the conversation?" and you don't understand the conversation at all, one good guess is to eliminate choices that contain something you heard. For example,<br><br>
		<ul>
		<b>Male:</b> I just found out I cant renew my lease for the next school year.<br>
		<b>Female:</b> Well, dont worry.  There should be plenty of apartments freeing up after graduation.<br>
		<b>Question:</b> What does the woman imply?<br><br>

		&#9830 (A) The man will easily find a place to live.<br>
		&#959 (B) Apartments will be less expensive next year before.<br>
		&#959 (C) The man should move graduation.<br>
		&#959 (D) Her lease ends after graduation.<br><br>
		</ul>
		For a better guess (if it is the only option), you can eliminate choice B because you clearly heard the word 'apartments' in the conversation, and choice C as well as choice D because you also heard the word 'graduation'. The only remaining is choice A.<br><br>

		<li>Understand commonly used idioms/phrases. For example 'I could not feel better' means 'I am feeling perfect', etc.<br><br>

		<li>For part B, you need to get the main idea and also pay attention to details, like, name, place, time, etc.
