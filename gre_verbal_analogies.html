		The only kind of relationship between words in GRE analogies is a clear and necessary one. This is a tight, solid, logical relationship based on the meaning of the words. It is the kind of relationship that exists between a word and its dictionary definition. <br><br>

		<p>In analogy questions, the relationship between the words is more important than the meanings of the words themselves. The analogy section of the GRE is one of the easiest parts of the test to improve on. The most common analogy relationships include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Synonyms</b>:  Synonyms are words that have similar meanings. <br><br>

			True synonyms are from the same part of speech. However, we will also classify as synonyms words which have similar meaning but come from different parts of speech, for example: UNRULY (adjective) : LAWLESSNESS (noun). <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: PERSPICACIOUS : INSIGHT :: 
				<ul>
					&#959 ardent : quickness <br>
					&#959 warm : temperature  <br>
					&#959 wealthy : scarcity <br>
					&#959 rapacious : magnanimity <br>
					&#9830 churlish : enmity <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: PERSPICACIOUS and INSIGHT are synonyms, both mean "sharp, keen of mind." Similarly, CHURLISH and ENMITY are synonyms; both mean "dislike, rudeness." Hence, the answer is shown above.<br><br>

			</ul>

			<li><b>Antonyms</b>: Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings.<br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: UNPRECEDENTED : PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE :: 

				<ul>
					&#959 naive : harmony <br>
					&#9830 incomparable : equal <br>
					&#959 improper : vacillation <br>
					&#959 eccentric : intensity <br>
					&#959 random : recidivism <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: UNPRECEDENTED means "without PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE." Similarly, INCOMPARABLE means "without EQUAL." Hence, the answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Member and Class</b>: Member and class analogies are very common problems, which may occur in the first third of an analogy section. <br><br>

			In this type of analogy, the first word may be an element of the class that the second word describes, or vice versa. This category can also be classified as "Type Of." <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: LIMERICK : POEM :: 

				<ul>
					&#959 monologue : chorus <br>
					&#959 sonnet : offering <br>
					&#959 waltz : tango <br>
					&#959 skull : skeleton <br>
					&#9830 aria : song <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A LIMERICK is a type of POEM. Similarly, an ARIA is a type of SONG. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Degree of Intensity</b>: In a degree-of-intensity analogy, the two words express a similar concept, but one word is stronger, harsher, or more intense than the other. <br><br>

			The degree of intensity in the answer-pair must be the same as in the original pair. People consider these problems to be hard. However, once you get used to them, they can become routine. <br><br>
			
			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: INTEREST : OBSESSION :: 
				<ul>
					&#959 faith : caprice <br>
					&#959 nonchalance : insouciance <br>
					&#959 diligence : assiduity <br>
					&#9830 decimation : annihilation <br>
					&#959 alacrity: procrastination <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: OBSESSION is extreme, unending INTEREST. Similarly, ANNIHILATION is complete DECIMATION. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>


			<li><b>Part and Whole</b>: In this type of analogy, the first word is part of the second word. The order can also be whole to part. 
<br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: ACTORS : TROUPE :: 
				<ul>
					&#9830 plotters : cabal <br>
					&#959 professors : tenure <br>
					&#959 workers : bourgeoisie  <br>
					&#959 diplomats : government <br>
					&#959 directors : cast  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A TROUPE is a group of ACTORS. Similarly, a CABAL is a group of PLOTTERS. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Definition</b>: In a definitional analogy one of the words can be used to define the other. <br><br>

			This is probably the most common type of analogy problem. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: COFFER : VALUABLES :: 
				<ul>
					&#959 mountain : avalanche <br>
					&#959 book : paper <br>
					&#959 vault : trifles <br>
					&#9830 sanctuary : refuge  <br>
					&#959 sea : waves  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: By definition, a coffer is a container in which to store valuables. Similarly, a SANCTUARY is by definition a place of REFUGE. The answer is shown above.<br><br>

			</ul>

			Sometimes the definition is only partial: stating only one of the characteristics of the word. <br><br>
			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: LION : CARNIVORE :: 
				<ul>
					&#959 man : vegetarian <br>
					&#959 ape : panderer <br>
					&#959 lizard : mammal <br>
					&#959 buffalo : omnivore <br>
					&#9830 shark : scavenger <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A defining characteristic of a LION is that it is CARNIVOROUS, meat-eating. Similarly, a defining characteristic of a SHARK is that it is a SCAVENGER. The answer is shown above. <br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Lack of</b>: In this type of analogy one word describes the absence of the other word. <br><br>

			This sub-category of the definition type of analogy is important and common enough to warrant a name.<br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: DISHEARTENED : HOPE :: 

				<ul>
					&#959 enervated : ennui <br>
					&#959 buoyant : effervescence  <br>
					&#9830 amoral : ethics  <br>
					&#959 munificent : altruism  <br>
					&#959 nefarious : turpitude  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: DISHEARTENED means without HOPE. Likewise, AMORAL means without ETHICS. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Manner</b>: This type of analogy describes the manner, way, or style by which an action is accomplished. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: PRATTLE : SPEAK :: 

				<ul>
					&#959 accept : reject  <br>
					&#959 stomp : patter   <br>
					&#959 heed : listen   <br>
					&#9830 promenade : walk  <br>
					&#959 ejaculate : shout  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: PRATTLE means to SPEAK in an idle, casual manner. Similarly, PROMENADE means to WALK in a casual manner. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Function</b>: This type of analogy describes the purpose or function of something. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: MNEMONIC : MEMORY ::  

				<ul>
					&#959 demonstration : manifestation  <br>
					&#9830 pacemaker : heartbeat   <br>
					&#959 sanction : recall   <br>
					&#959 rhetoric : treatise  <br>
					&#959 impasse : fruition  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A MNEMONIC functions to aid MEMORY. Similarly, a PACEMAKER aids in the regulation of one's HEARTBEAT.  The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Action and Significance</b>: In this type of analogy one word describes an action and the other word indicates the significance of the action. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: CURTSY : REVERENCE ::  

				<ul>
					&#959 assume : disguise  <br>
					&#959 bestir : deferment   <br>
					&#959 fret : contentment   <br>
					&#959 forgo : diversion  <br>
					&#9830 fidget : uneasiness  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A CURTSY (bow) is a sign of REVERENCE. Similarly, FIDGETING is a sign of UNEASINESS.  The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>


			<li><b>Pertaining to</b>: In this type of analogy, one word refers to the category or class the other word belongs to. An example will illustrate. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: DIDACTIC : TEACH :: 

				<ul>
					&#959 specious : revile  <br>
					&#959 cunning : steal <br>
					&#9830 forensic : debate  <br>
					&#959 troubled : broach  <br>
					&#959 puissant : injure  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: DIDACTIC refers to the teaching process. Similarly, FORENSIC refers to the debating process. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Symbol and Representation</b>: In this type of analogy, one word stands for or represents a concept, action, or thing. An example will illustrate. <br><br>

			<ul>
				<b>Ex</b>ample: CARET : INSERT:: 

				<ul>
					&#959 colon : sever  <br>
					&#959 pie : exponentiate  <br>
					&#959 gun : lance   <br>
					&#9830 period : stop  <br>
					&#959 scalpel : delete  <br><br>
				</ul>

				<b>Ex</b>planation: A CARET (^) is an editing symbol that indicates where a word should be INSERTED. Similarly, a PERIOD is a grammatical symbol indicating a STOP. The answer is shown above.<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Cause and effect</b>: In this type of analogy, one word stands for the reason and the other for the result.<br><br>
			<ul>
				For example: DRUG : CURE<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Agent and Action</b>: In this type of analogy, one word is the agent to do the action.<br><br>
			<ul>
				For example: BRAIN : THINKING<br><br>
			</ul>

			<li><b>Component and Product</b>: In this type of analogy, one word is the component of the other.<br><br>
			<ul>
				For example: BUTTER : CAKE<br><br>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<table bgColor="#C6EFFF"><tr><td><a name="2">Test Tips</a></td></tr></table>

		<ul>
				<li><b>Learn to recognize common types of analogies. Get familiar with the above common types.</b><br><br>

				<li><b>Before you look at the answer-choices, think of a short sentence that expresses the relationship between the two words.</b><br><br>

				<ul>
					<b>Sa</b>mple: ORCHESTRA : MUSICIAN :: 

					<ul>
						&#959 story : comedian <br>
						&#959 band : singer  <br>
						&#959 garden : leaf  <br>
						&#9830 troupe : actor <br>
						&#959 government : lawyer <br><br>
					</ul>

					<b>Ex</b>planation: Paraphrase: "An ORCHESTRA is comprised of MUSICIANS." Now, a STORY is not comprised of COMEDIANS. Eliminate (A). A BAND may have a SINGER, but a BAND is not comprised of SINGERS: there may be a drummer, guitarist, etc. Eliminate (B). Similarly, a GARDEN is comprised of more than just LEAVES. Eliminate (C). But a TROUPE is comprised of ACTORS. The answer, therefore, is (D).
<br><br>
				</ul>

				<li><b>If more than one answer-vhoice fits your paraphrase, make your paraphrase more specific.</b> <br><br>
				<ul>
					<b>Sa</b>mple: CLUB : GOLF :: 
					<ul>
						&#959 type : book <br>
						&#959 ball : soccer <br>
						&#959 glove : baseball <br>
						&#9830 racket : tennis <br>
						&#959 board : chess <br><br>
					</ul>

					<b>Ex</b>planation: Paraphrase: "A CLUB is used to play GOLF." However, this paraphrase eliminates only answer-choice (A). A more specific paraphrase is: A CLUB is used to strike a ball in the game of GOLF. Similarly, a RACKET is used to strike a ball in the game of TENNIS. The answer is (D). <br><br>
				</ul>

				<li><b>Eliminate answer-choices that do not have a clear and reasonably necessary relationship.</b> <br><br>

				You can automatically eliminate any answer choice containing a triangular nonrelationship. In a triangular nonrelationship, the two words are related to a third word, but not directly to each other. For example: WEIGHT : AGE <br><br>

				Educated guessing is a very useful technique on the GRE. If you can eliminate one or more answer-choices, you will probably increase your score by guessing. <br><br>
				<ul>
					<b>Sa</b>mple: CORROSION : IRON :: 
					<ul>
						&#959 sloth : energy <br>
						&#959 disease : vision <br>
						&#9830 atrophy : muscle <br>
						&#959 neighbor: bonus <br>
						&#959 draft: poker <br><br>
					</ul>

					<b>Ex</b>planation: In choices (A) and (C) there are clear and reasonably necessary relationships between the words of each pair: a SLOTHFUL person lacks ENERGY, and ATROPHY means "the wasting away of MUSCLE." But in choice (B) there is no necessary relationship between the words: most DISEASES have no effect on VISION. Hence, eliminate choice (B). Choices (D) and (E) have the same reasons. The correct answer is (C) since CORROSION is the wasting away of IRON, just as ATROPHY is the wasting away of MUSCLE. <br><br>
				</ul>


				<li><b>Never initially eliminate a choice if you are uncertain of the meaning of either word in it.</b><br><br>

 				You cant be positive that two words are unrelated if you have no idea what one of the words means.<br><br>

				<li><b>Watch out for eye-catchers. Beware of obvious answers! They may be there only to mislead you. </b> <br><br>

				Unfortunately, the ETS often sets traps by offering an answer-pair that reminds you of the original pair but has a different relationship. The correct answer-pair, of course, will have the same relationship as the original pair, but the words in the answer will typically be in an entirely different category.<br><br>

				<ul>
					<b>Sa</b>mple: EXCERPT : NOVEL :: 
					<ul>
						&#959 critique : play <br>
						&#959 review : manuscript <br>
						&#9830 swatch : cloth <br>
						&#959 foreword : preface <br>
						&#959 recital : performance <br><br>
					</ul>

					<b>Ex</b>planation: Notice how in answer-choice (B) MANUSCRIPT reminds you of NOVEL: a manuscript could be an unpublished novel. However, a REVIEW is not part of a manuscript. Whereas, an EXCERPT is part of a NOVEL. (What is the other eye-catcher in this problem?) The answer is (C). <br><br>
				</ul>

				<li><b>In hard problems, eliminate any answer-choice that reminds you (however vaguely) of the original pair.</b> <br><br>

				Eye-catchers are sometimes the answer to easy problems; rarely are they the answer to medium problems; and virtually never are they the answer to hard problems. When an average student guesses on a hard problem he chooses an answer that reminds him of the original pair. But if the eye-catcher were the answer, then the average student would get the problem correct and therefore it would not be a hard problem. <br><br>

				<ul>
					<b>Sa</b>mple: EXORCISM : DEMON :: 
					<ul>
						&#959 matriculation : induction <br>
						&#9830 banishment : member <br>
						&#959 qualm : angel <br>
						&#959 heuristic : method <br>
						&#959 manifesto : spirit <br><br>
					</ul>

					<b>Ex</b>planation: This is a hard problem. Hence, eliminate any answer-choice that reminds you (however vaguely) of DEMON. A DEMON is a SPIRIT. So eliminate choice (E). Next, choice (C) is not strictly speaking an eye-catcher. But an ANGEL does remind one of a DEMON, and this is a hard problem. So eliminate choice (C). Now, to EXORCISE a DEMON means to drive it away. Similarly, to a BANISH a MEMBER of a group means to drive him or her away. The answer is (B).<br><br>
				</ul>

				<li><b>When you dont know the meaning of one of the words in the stem, work backwards from the choices.</b><br><br>

				You can improve the effectiveness of working backward by using information in the problem to decode the unknown word in the stem. <br><br>

				<li><b>Do not choose an answer with a reversed relationship.</b><br><br>

				This is perhaps the most common error in the section. If the question is BOY: MAN, the answer cannot be WOMAN: GIRL. The relationship would be one of progression; a boy grows into a man. A woman does not grow into a girl; the relationship is reversed. <br><br>

				<li><b>Do not choose answers based on the meanings of the words.</b><br><br>

				If the questions are about computers, the answers may very easily be about chocolate cake. The meanings themselves are irrelevant; you are only concerned with the relationships between the pairs of words.<br><br>

				<li><b>Consider alternative meanings of words, as well as alternative parts of speech.</b></br><br>

				<li><b>If you don't know the meaning a word, try to recall if you've ever heard it in an expression. The context of the expression may suggest the meaning of the word. </b><br><br>
