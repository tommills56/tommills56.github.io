<p><b>CHANGE MODE</b></p>

<p>The EnglishMaster&reg; provides users with either <b><font color="blue">FREE</font></b> usage mode or <b><font color="blue">CHARGE</font></b> usage mode. With <b><font color="blue">FREE</font></b> usage mode, a user can only access a very limited test content resource with limited time and functionality. And with <b><font color="blue">CHARGE</font></b> usage mode, a user can fully use all functionality and access all test content resources, which are continuously updated. When users login the system, they are in the <b><font color="blue">FREE</font></b> mode by default.</p>


<p>Currently we provide user with four usage modes: Free, Economic, BestChoice, and Unlimited. All modes except Free are charged modes.</p>
<p>All usage time within EnglishMaster is monthly based. The usage time in CHARGE mode is called charge time and the usage time in FREE mode called free time. Different usage time is counted separately.</p>

<p>When you click the <input type="button" value="CHANGE MODE"> button, the system is changed to another usage mode and the new title is displayed on the upper part of the main window, which clearly indicates the current usage mode.</p>

<p>Click <input type="button" value="ACCOUNT"> button and log in to see a detailed list of all available usage modes. Then you can select and buy a suitable usage mode and enjoy your selection.</p>
